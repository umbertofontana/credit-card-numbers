# Random valid C.C. number generator and C.C. number checker 
A bash script that can be used as a (pseudo)random valid credit card number generator (**generator.sh**), and a C program that can be used as a credit card number checker (**checker.c**).

Both based on Luhn Algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm).
